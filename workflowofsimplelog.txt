Basic Logger:
	
	Config Variables:
		
		storage_threshold = 80%  -> #This value is used to log will start or not.
		max_file_size = 10mb  -> #The maximum size of the log file. if size achieved create a new file with timestamps.
		log_directory = "/logs"  -> #This tells the where we want to store the log files.
		log_directory_max_size = 100mb  -> #The maximum size of the log file. if size achieved compression will be start.
		max_compressions = 70%  -> #The maximun compression of the folder. after achieved the log_directory_max_size.
		
		
	Execution:
		
		logger.SystemStorage() -> check the storage capacity of the system and check storage_threshold. if the value of the systemstorage < storage_threshold return the bool value other wise return bool and raise exception "can't intialise due to low memeory".
			eg:	
				storage = SystemStorage(storage_threshold) # returns true or false
		
		logger.iniatilize_logger() -> if the SystemStorage() returns true starts the logger iniatilize logger. we need to set the file_type default("Must be initilize") and compress default(false). if all good execute successfully retun the bool value (true) otherwise (false).
			eg:
				if storage:
					logger = iniatilize_logger(file_type = "excel", compress=true) # returns true or false
				else:
					raise exception ("logger can't be initilize because there is no sufficient memory for logging.")
					
		logger.header() -> log starter if the iniatilize_logger return true. other wise raise exception. In this we need to set the headers of the file by manually. #After returns the bool value if its pass or fail.
			eg:
				if logger:
					loggerHeaders = logger.headers("","","","","")
				else:
					raise exception ("logger can't be initilize headers because there is exception in the initilize of the logger.")
					
		logger.logs() -> data logging starts here after successfully completed previous functions. In this function we write the logs to the log_file with the payloads of headers we initilize. 
			eg: 
				if loggerHeaders:
					logger.logs()
				else:
					raise exception ("data logging not working there is an error in the loggerheader.")
					
					
	
	WorkFlow:
		
		1. user imports the logger.
		2. user initilize the logger.
		3. user sets the headers of the logs.
		4. based on the headers writes logs.
		5. start the logger.
		6. publishing the data to the logger QUEUE (repeat).
		7. worker writes the Queue data to the file (repeat).
		8. stop the logger gracefully.
		
		
	Execution class:
		
		class Logger:
			
			def __init__(self): -> initilize the logger
			
			def start(self): -> starts the logger
			
			def publish(self): -> publish data to the Queue
						
			def stop(self): -> stops the logger
		 	 
		 	def _telementryworker(): -> writes the Queue data to the file
		 	
		 	def _eventworker(): -> writes the Queue data to the file
		 	
		 	def _systemStorage(): -> checks the storage before initilize the logger
		 	
		 	def header(self): -> set header by user choice
		 	
		 	def _file(): -> checks the file size and folder size
